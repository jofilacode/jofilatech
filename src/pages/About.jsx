      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>@jofilacode</strong></p>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate and results-driven <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> with over <strong>10 years of experience</strong> building secure, scalable, and high-performance solutions across <strong>web and desktop platforms</strong>. My core expertise includes <strong>React, Node.js, ASP.NET Core, MongoDB, SQL Server</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>â€”technologies I use to craft user-centric, reliable software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working in key roles across several companies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Supervisor at Imagination Tools</strong> â€“ Leading architecture and full-cycle development for innovative digital products.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Engineer & Lead Data Analysis Tutor at OMNI MEDIA</strong> â€“ Building tools and platforms while mentoring aspiring data professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Developer at Incredible Wealth Coin (IWC)</strong> â€“ Driving blockchain-based crypto solutions and decentralized app development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm currently diving deep into future-forward technologies including <strong>Web3, Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Systems</strong>, and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. I believe these fields are shaping the next generation of tech, and Iâ€™m committed to evolving alongside them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether Iâ€™m writing code, leading a team, or teaching others, my mission remains the same: <em>to create intelligent solutions that solve real-world problems and deliver impact.</em>
